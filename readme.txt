- What is Adrenaline? -
  Adrenaline is a software that modifies the official PSP Emulator using taiHEN CFW framework
  to make it run a PSP 6.61 custom firmware. Thanks to the power of taiHEN, Adrenaline can
  inject custom code into the IPL which allows unsigned code to run at boottime.
  
- IMPORTANT NOTE -
  For 6.61 Adrenaline-2 or higher, you must put Adrenaline files to 'ux0:adrenaline' instead of 'ux0:pspemu/adrenaline'.
  
- Changelog v4 -
  - Added custom graphics filtering support for PS1 games.
  - Added screen mode adjustment for PS1 games. If you're using this feature on a PS Vita, select 'Original' screen mode in the
    offical settings, then apply the custom screen mode. On the other hand, if you want to the screen mode of the official settings,
	select 'Original' screen mode in Adrenaline settings. On a PS TV this will finally allow you to play your games in fullscreen.

- How to install Adrenaline -
  * Install any PSP game/demo onto your PS Vita (compatiblity for PS1 games as bubble will be added in the future).
  * Shutdown your PS Vita and visit http://beta.henkaku.xyz/.
  * Launch molecularShell, press START and set 'Enable unsafe homebrews' to 'On'.
  * Reboot your PS Vita and then install VitaShell from molecularShell (https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/VitaShell/releases).
  * In VitaShell open FTP by pressing SELECT and copy the 'adrenaline' folder from the archive and paste it at 'ux0:'.
  * Download the 6.61 EBOOT.PBP (for 1000/2000/3000) from the Sony server (google it)
    and paste it at 'ux0:adrenaline/661.PBP'.
  * Copy 'ux0:tai/config.txt' to your PC and add the following lines:
        *KERNEL
        ux0:adrenaline/adrenaline.skprx

        *TITLEID
        ux0:adrenaline/adrenaline.suprx

    Example of config.txt:
        # You must reboot for changes to take place.
        *KERNEL
        ux0:adrenaline/adrenaline.skprx
        *main
        # main is a special titleid for SceShell
        ux0:app/MLCL00001/henkaku.suprx
        *NPXS10015
        # this is for modifying the version string
        ux0:app/MLCL00001/henkaku.suprx
        *TITLEID
        ux0:adrenaline/adrenaline.suprx

    Note that you replace TITLEID by the titleid of your PSP game (the name of the folder where EBOOT.PBP is).
  * Reboot your device and revisit the page I have mentioned above.
  * Launch the game for which you have added the plugin's line to config.txt.
  * Follow the instructions on screen.
  * Enjoy
  
- About right analog stick in games -
  The right analog patch for GTA LCS/GTA VCS will be downloaded from here: https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/GTA_Remastered
