6.61 Adrenaline
================================================================================

A software that transforms your PS Vita into a two-in-one device

What is Adrenaline?
-------------------
Adrenaline is a software that modifies the official PSP Emulator using [taiHEN CFW framework](https://github.com/yifanlu/taiHEN)
to make it run a PSP 6.61 custom firmware. Thanks to the power of taiHEN, Adrenaline can
inject custom code into the IPL which allows unsigned code to run at boottime.

How to install
--------------
1. Download [Adrenaline.vpk](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/Adrenaline/releases) and install it using [VitaShell](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/VitaShell/releases).
2. Launch Adrenaline and press ❌ to download the 6.61 firmware. After finishing it will automatically terminate.
3. Relaunch Adrenaline, this time it will go into pspemu mode. Follow the instructions on screen.

How to update
-------------
If you have already been using Adrenaline and want to quickly update, simply open Adrenaline.vpk as zip file and copy all modules from sce_module to ux0:app/PSPEMUCFW/sce_module.

Getting rid of double launch bug
--------------------------------
Adrenaline has been redesigned in `6.61 Adrenaline-6`, so you'd need to launch Adrenaline twice everytime you reboot your device. To get rid of that, simply write this line to `*KERNEL`

```text
*KERNEL
ux0:app/PSPEMUCFW/sce_module/adrenaline_kernel.skprx
```

Network update
--------------
For 6.61 Adrenaline-6.4 or higher, you can use the `System Update` in the XMB to update Adrenaline to the latest version.
1. Choose 'System Update' in XMB, then click `Update via Internet`.
2. If a connection name does already exist, skip to step 5.
3. Otherwise select `[New Connection]`, then `Enter Manually`, press RIGHT three times until you need to enter a connection name.
4. Type any connection name and press RIGHT two times. You'll now see the message `Press the ❌/⭕ button to save settings`.
5. Press ❌/⭕ on any connection name.
6. Follow the instructions to update Adrenaline.
7. After updating and rebooting you can then delete the update file.
